# NPC State v0.2.21 Code Review

## v0.2.21 ownership/lifecycle deep-pass hardening

The v0.2.20 post-release deep pass found two wrong-owner same-filename paths: ownerless delete trusted a sole internal candidate without host proof, and explicit-owner rename could fall through to another owner when the requested owner had no state. v0.2.21 centralizes live ownership resolution in pure helpers, excludes tombstone/recovery/branch-index history from live evidence, makes explicit owner identity absolute, and requires authoritative host absence proof for every ownerless destructive delete including the one-candidate case.

Lifecycle event waits are bounded because SillyTavern awaits listeners sequentially. Transactions that exceed the foreground budget remain fail-closed in the background; fast failures receive a delayed retry. Lifecycle-only sidecar writes use bounded retry rather than joining the ordinary endless dirty-write loop. Character-wide rename/delete isolates each chat transaction and always invalidates owner caches in `finally`.

Recovery filenames include a writer token for cross-tab uniqueness, sidecar ISO timestamps are parsed to numeric milliseconds, meaningful branch/social/portrait/inline destination state is protected during rename, historical rename indexing is bounded and rejects partial HTTP indexes, and failed temporary recovery cleanup is queued for later garbage collection. Settings schema is 27.

## v0.2.20 lifecycle/cache convergence

The v0.2.19 deep pass found a split authority between the new hardening wrapper and the retained engine's private cache. v0.2.20 removes the shared-event-emitter monkey-patch and returns primary chat rename/delete ownership to the cache-aware engine. Destructive operations now refresh the latest durable revision, stage recovery/destination state, retire the source with compare-and-swap semantics, and only then publish tombstones or ownership moves. Active rename targets created by SillyTavern's pre-event reload are recognized as ephemeral and replaced with the migrated dossier rather than treated as collisions.

Branch lineage advances to v4. Mutable display names remain excluded, while stable message-instance identity (send_date, with generation id fallback) differentiates identical text spoken by different group speakers or alternate generations. v3 text-only lineages migrate explicitly, and authoritative main_chat provenance can inherit a root snapshot before generic 4-message/2-user heuristics are satisfied.

Character-owner rename/delete now flushes and invalidates retained-engine caches through an explicit lifecycle bridge. Historical rename rebasing covers both solo and group chats, using one bounded integrity index per character rename instead of repeatedly scanning every group chat. Hydration self-heals stale revision tokens from the sidecar payload, and recovery-history eviction queues the corresponding physical files for deletion.

Filename-only delete events now use authoritative negative host ownership when multiple owner-qualified states share the same filename: exactly one absent owner and all remaining owners still claiming the file is required before destructive cleanup. Owner-wide rename/delete and legacy migration physically remove retired canonical predecessors only after synchronous metadata durability. Recovery filenames use a monotonic generation so same-millisecond lifecycle operations cannot collide.

Release verification executes the complete Node/compatibility/runtime/migration suite ten consecutive times on the exact candidate before main is updated.

## v0.2.18 verified release promotion

The v0.2.17 identity/storage hardening candidate is promoted as v0.2.18 after the release pipeline itself was corrected. Runtime behavior is unchanged from the fully hardened candidate: owner-qualified chat identity, owner-scoped ancestry, lineage-gated legacy migration, destructive tombstone authority, bounded branch snapshots, portrait garbage collection, bounded dormant-chat caching, clean hydration revisions, and immediate persistence for high-value manual mutations remain intact.

**Release-process fix:** production `ci.yml` is read-only and version-neutral. The temporary v0.2.18 gate is a separate workflow and never attempts to commit or modify workflow files, avoiding GitHub App workflow-permission rejection. The exact v0.2.18 candidate must complete ten consecutive full passes before promotion to `main`.

## v0.2.17 identity and storage hardening

**Critical: ordinary character chat keys were not owner-qualified.** Two different character cards could use the same SillyTavern chat filename and collide in cache, sidecar, tombstone, and branch-index ownership. Canonical keys now include character avatar identity plus chat id; group keys include group id plus active group-chat id. Rename/delete lifecycle resolution prefers event-provided ownership and fails closed when an owner-less lookup is ambiguous.

**High: cross-chat branch ancestry was not owner-scoped.** Candidate ancestor loading and inheritance now require the same qualified owner scope before narrative-prefix matching is considered.

**High: legacy namespace migration could guess ownership or lose old branch semantics.** Unqualified v0.2.16-and-earlier sidecars migrate lazily only after stored lineage proves the active conversation owns them. Both current content lineage and pre-v0.2.11 swipe-index lineage are recognized. The destination sidecar is written and verified before the old namespace is retired, and migrated branch state is canonicalized before its first durable write.

**High: branch history and portraits could inflate long-session sidecars.** Checkpoint snapshots retain the existing count cap but now also obey a serialized-character budget, preserving a safe active anchor plus newest useful states. Portrait assets are rebuilt against live or branch-restorable NPC ids and permanent deletion tombstones so unreachable binary data cannot accumulate forever.

**Medium: hydrated chats accumulated indefinitely in browser memory.** A bounded dormant-chat cache evicts settled non-active states while refusing to evict chats with pending load/write/scan work.

**Medium: unchanged hydration looked dirty and destructive tombstones could lose a crash race.** Successful unchanged sidecar hydration initializes the persisted revision, avoiding needless page-hide rewrites. A persisted destructive tombstone now outranks any stale live pointer left behind by an interrupted delete/retire sequence.

**Medium: explicit user mutations still waited for the ordinary scan debounce.** Manual edits, imports, deletion, archive/restore, clear, OOC changes, and portrait changes now start persistence immediately; versioned writers still coalesce any newer mutation safely.

**Verification:** release gating runs the complete Node, SillyTavern compatibility, runtime smoke, migration smoke, syntax, and diff checks ten consecutive times from a clean application of the hardening patch, followed by dedicated identity/storage adversarial tests. No release commit is created until the entire gate succeeds.

## v0.2.13 runtime lifecycle hardening

**High: rendering/injection could race chat hydration.** Dossier surfaces and RP injection are now gated until the active chat state is fully hydrated, preventing transient unloaded state from becoming visible or model-facing state.

**High: automatic scans could be lost while another scan was active.** Busy automatic work now coalesces per chat and drains after the active scan finishes instead of being silently discarded.

**Medium: branch rescans used bounded polling retries.** The retry loop was replaced with deterministic pending-work coalescing, removing timer churn while preserving the newest valid assistant turn.

**High: rapid chat switching could allow stale async completion.** Chat-change hydration and branch reconciliation now re-check active chat identity after awaits and reject stale completion.

**Verification:** two complete hard passes each finished at 320/320 tests, with zero failures, plus syntax, SillyTavern 1.18 compatibility, runtime smoke, migration smoke, and one-level package-layout checks.



## v0.2.12 two hard-pass findings

### Hard pass 1 - identity/family resolution

**High: canonical promotion stopped at the promoted dossier.** Neighboring Key Relationships could preserve both an interim label and the later proper name (`Thunderbird — clone sister`, `Mina — clone sister`). Structured references are now alias-aware and canonicalized by stable NPC id; duplicates collapse while historical prose remains untouched.

**High: old saves could already contain split identities.** Explicit alias-linked interim/proper dossiers now merge conservatively. The older stable id and strongest relationship history survive, graph endpoints remap, and ambiguous aliases are deliberately left unresolved.

**Medium: unnamed family facts were not identities.** Count-aware unresolved slots now retain singular/plural/twin family facts, support partial later naming, and resolve only from an established social edge. `a daughter`, `twin daughters`, and explicit parent-of phrasing are covered.

**Medium: descriptor capture could leak from unrelated prose.** Older/younger descriptors are now restricted to the local sentence containing the family fact instead of scanning the full exchange.

### Hard pass 2 - persistence, scale, branch state, and runtime salience

**High: permanent deletion could leave stale social text after old-sibling restoration.** Dismissal overlay now strips graph endpoints and structured references together. OOC/story removal gets the same branch-specific graph cleanup without becoming a global UI deletion.

**High: social salience initially resolved only against the present-NPC subset.** Mentions of an off-screen child could therefore fail to make a present parent relevant. Salience now resolves graph counterpart names against the full registry while injection still filters to confirmed-present NPCs.

**Medium: hard-pruned dossiers could leave dangling graph ids.** Social reconciliation prunes edges/unresolved owners missing from the current registry. Archive/death remains preserved because archived dossiers still exist.

**Medium: inferred sibling expansion could crowd explicit social facts in a large family.** Inferred pair expansion is bounded and is never allowed to evict explicit/manual/strong-context edges at the graph limit.

**Medium: inverse social wording lost useful symmetry.** Best/close friend and rival/cousin wording now remains symmetric; wife/husband/spouse reverses safely to `spouse` rather than guessing gender.

### Compatibility

Settings schema advances to v24. v0.2.11 dossiers construct graph state conservatively from already-resolvable structured relationships and explicit family counts. Existing visible player-relationship scores, fractional evidence, milestones, portraits, aliases, manual locks, custom rubrics, exact sibling snapshots, and historical prose are preserved.

## v0.2.11 triple deep-pass findings

### Pass 1 - relationship milestone semantics

**High: checkpoint-blocked evidence could overwrite Last Relationship Change.** A valid event stopped by a locked boundary changed neither the visible meter nor fractional progress, but could still become the latest relationship-change audit. The event is now retained only in recent dedupe history unless it changes score/progress or unlocks a milestone.

**High: Relationship Summary could outrun a locked milestone.** An empty summary could initialize with deepest/absolute trust or exceptional attachment language while the numeric axis was parked at a locked 25/50/75 boundary. Summary validation now checks directional milestone depth as part of canon consistency.

**Medium: first-message swipes had no parent checkpoint.** A greeting/opening swipe at message 0 could fall back to live state from the previous sibling. A pre-message root snapshot now anchors first-message alternatives.

### Pass 2 - exact sibling swipe restoration

**High: v0.2.10 branch fingerprints were not directly reusable.** They included `swipe_id`, while v0.2.11 content-lineage identity intentionally does not. Legacy checkpoints now migrate only when the complete old fingerprint prefix still matches the loaded chat; edited/stale history is dropped.

**High: a provisional turn checkpoint could falsely mark an unfinished sibling exact.** The assistant handler used to checkpoint a scan-due child before its asynchronous scan completed. Swiping away could discard the stale scan but leave that provisional state available as an exact restore. Scan-due turns now become exact only when the completed scan lands.

**Medium: swipe-index identity was unstable after alternate deletion.** Sibling identity now uses content lineage, not SillyTavern's renumberable `swipe_id`; inline cards use the same lineage key. Branch pruning remains bounded and preserves active/recent sibling anchors.

### Pass 3 - persistence, concurrency, migration, and user state

**High: milestone qualification trusted impact labels too much.** A weak evaluator could label a tiny change `extreme`. Checkpoint crossing now requires both the minimum impact tier and a minimum raw evidence weight, scaled safely against custom caps.

**High: manual UI deletion could be resurrected by an old sibling snapshot.** Permanent user deletion suppression now lives outside narrative snapshots and is re-applied after branch restoration. Explicit Add/import can lift the matching alias group deliberately; story/OOC removals remain branch-specific.

**Medium: branch exactness needed stronger collision resistance and persistence coverage.** New lineage keys use two independent hash lanes, and tests now round-trip root snapshots, sibling keys, fractional relationship progress, milestone audit entries, recent evidence history, and user deletion suppression through sidecar/bundle/branch paths.

### Compatibility

Settings schema advances to v23. Existing visible relationship scores are not rescaled. Established v0.2.10 scores infer already-passed directional milestones strictly below their current magnitude, customized tuning remains authoritative, and exact legacy branch conversion requires verified history rather than optimistic migration.

## v0.2.10 weighting hard-pass findings

### High: v0.2.9 inertia still leaked +1 ordinary gains at high scores

**Finding:** v0.2.9 multiplied high-score gains by inertia but then forced every accepted non-zero event to apply at least one whole point. Ordinary +1 therefore bypassed resistance and could ratchet 95 to 100 in five events.

**Resolution:** relationship evidence now accumulates fractionally per axis. The 95+ band uses 10% deepening weight, so ten distinct ordinary +1 beats are needed for one displayed point. No artificial minimum visible delta remains.

### High: relationship prose and raw scores could still overpower identity

**Finding:** generation could receive both raw relationship numbers and Relationship Summary. A weak model could also persist unsupported romance/possessive prose even when Desire was neutral.

**Resolution:** RP injection contains one qualitative relationship lens and no raw meter values. Established Relationship Summary changes only after an accepted new event, and axis-aware summary validation rejects unsupported romance, possessiveness, obsession, or absolute dependency.

### High: grounded events could be assigned to the wrong relationship axis

**Finding:** a rescue reason could be story-grounded while a weak model incorrectly awarded Desire.

**Resolution:** every non-zero axis now has separate evidence. Desire requires attraction/intimacy cues in both its evidence and the actual narration; rescue/gratitude/affection/trust/proximity alone cannot authorize it.

### Medium: dedupe remembered only the latest event

**Finding:** `A -> B -> aftermath A` could make A eligible again because lastRelationshipChange had become B.

**Resolution:** keep a bounded six-event evidence history and compare new awards against all recent events. The history and fractional remainder survive bundle/sidecar/branch persistence.

### Medium: v0.2.9 stock migration detection was initially too permissive

**Finding:** prefix-based stock detection could have mistaken a customized rubric retaining the stock opening sentence for untouched stock.

**Resolution:** v0.2.9 migration detection now compares the exact historical stock rubric strings. Customized text is preserved byte-for-byte.

### Compatibility

Settings schema advances to v22. Untouched v0.2.8/v0.2.9 stock settings migrate to `1/2/5/10`; customized caps/rubrics and existing visible relationship scores are never rescaled. New fractional progress defaults to zero when absent.

## v0.2.9 relationship-inertia findings

### High: valid relationship deltas accumulated too quickly in long-form RP

**Previous risk:** stock caps allowed `+4` ordinary and `+8` meaningful movement per scored exchange, with linear accumulation and no resistance near established extremes. Several moderately emotional scenes could move a relationship across behavioral thresholds quickly.

**Resolution:** stock caps are `1/3/8/20`; ordinary/meaningful events are axis-limited; deepening established polarity receives score-dependent inertia, while contrary evidence remains able to move toward neutral at full tier strength.

### High: relationship context remained too prominent during generation

**Previous risk:** every essential NPC block carried raw four-axis stats plus up to 430 characters of generated player-directed behavior, while durable Relationship Summary could be added early as optional continuity. This could make the player relationship the dominant narrative lens even though identity technically appeared first.

**Resolution:** generation order is now Identity, Agency/non-player bonds, Current State, then a <=160-character secondary relationship modifier. Low-score axes collapse to one neutral/unsettled cue. Mood/Status are essential; Relationship Summary is late optional context. Relationship magnitude was removed from relevance scoring.

### High: one relationship event could be rewarded repeatedly across its aftermath

**Resolution:** focused evaluation receives the last scored event and explicitly treats routine aftermath as zero. The merge layer independently rejects recent semantically duplicate reasons. Dedupe requires reason similarity plus recency; message ID equality alone is insufficient because a swipe/edit may materially change the same message.

### Medium: removing relationship salience exposed partial-name relevance

**Finding:** an established `Falia Rendel` could fail runtime selection when prose referred only to `Falia` and no other relevance signal existed.

**Resolution:** grounded first-token matching is allowed for multi-token canonical names when the first token is at least four characters, keeping relationship score out of salience.

### Compatibility

Settings schema advances to v21. Untouched v0.2.8 stock caps and relationship/impact/behavior rubrics migrate to the v0.2.9 defaults. Customized caps/rubrics remain unchanged. Existing dossier relationship scores are not rescaled or reset.

## v0.2.8 canon-hygiene findings

### High: structurally valid scanner text could still be semantically overcommitted

**Previous risk:** v0.2.7 correctly protected established identity from large rewrites, but accepted wording could still overstate a modest relationship (`indispensable` at low scores), seed unexplained relationship drift, or place a PC-specific incident into target-general Behavioral Profile prose.

**Resolution:** generated non-zero relationship changes require a grounded reason; relationship summaries are intensity-calibrated; target-specific/global scope is checked before Behavioral Profile persistence; manual edits remain authoritative.

### Medium: Apparent Age formatting could drift into free-form prose

**Previous behavior:** digit forms normalized reliably, but weaker-model output such as `around six`, `Twenties`, or `mid thirties` could remain prose or vary in presentation.

**Resolution:** English number words and decade language normalize to deterministic `~N`; equivalent wording shares a stable seeded estimate. Unlocked Appearance removes redundant leading explicit-age phrases.

### Medium: repeated animations inflated Mannerisms and profile categories

**Resolution:** known repeated gesture families compact to one behavioral pattern, while Behavioral Profile families such as Conflict/Anger/Composure merge into one concise rule. Six Behavioral Profile entries remain a cap, not a fill target.

### Medium: social-graph grammar could misidentify who was deceased

**Resolution:** trailing `(deceased)` syntax is rewritten into explicit `Surviving widow/widower` or `; deceased` forms, eliminating ambiguous attachment.

### Medium: durable Importance and runtime relevance were conflated

**Resolution:** scanner output cannot rewrite stored Importance. Runtime selection scores contextual salience from mentions, role/goal/memory relevance, grounded name references, and recency instead of manual Importance; v0.2.9 deliberately removes relationship magnitude from salience.

### Actual Noctis export verification

The supplied `.npcstate` fixture was decoded and normalized with v0.2.8. Observed corrections include Brina `Twenties -> ~24`, Liza/Tessa retained at `~6` with redundant `five-year-old` appearance wording removed, Brina's unsupported `indispensable source of physical comfort and survival` wording reframed as `a growing source of practical support and comfort` and the blank-reason audit cleared, intimacy-specific global Behavioral Profile text removed, Maren's three paperwork gestures compacted to one pattern, Toran `Thirties -> ~31`, and Jonas's ambiguous widow/death phrase made explicit.

## v0.2.7 final hard-pass findings

### High: blank durable fields were easier to poison than populated identity

**Previous risk:** a weak scanner could fail to rewrite an established Personality yet seed a previously empty Personality/Speech/Appearance or first Mannerism from one relationship-heavy scene, effectively making a first impression permanent canon.

**Resolution:** with source narration available, blank durable text fields require direct lexical grounding or repeated related evidence before first population. A first Mannerism requires explicit recurrence or repeated evidence. Repeated evidence must also support the proposed value, so concept-matched evidence cannot authorize an unrelated trait.

### High: string booleans could invert scanner intent

**Previous behavior:** JavaScript truthiness treated values such as `present:"false"`, `sameIndividual:"false"`, or `clearMood:"false"` as true in several compatibility paths.

**Resolution:** scanner, stored-state, and legacy shorthand booleans use explicit coercion for boolean/number/common string forms.

### High: stale async scans could race newer dossier edits

**Previous risk:** chat-lineage checks prevented stale story scans, but a manual/import dossier edit made while model generation was pending could still be overwritten by output generated against the older state.

**Resolution:** scan start captures a per-chat dossier-state revision; both primary and focused relationship results are discarded if that revision changes before commit.

### Medium: high-resolution portraits were duplicated in sidecar JSON

**Resolution:** persisted NPC records omit portrait bytes when the portrait asset table contains them. Live NPC portrait data refreshes the asset copy before compaction, preventing stale image resurrection.

### Medium: archived dossiers incorrectly consumed bundle-import capacity

**Resolution:** import caps count active dossiers only; archived history is preserved independently.

### Medium: social evolution could erase unrelated bonds

**Resolution:** Key Relationship updates replace/merge the named counterpart only; omission is not interpreted as deletion. Scanner/import/refresh prompt wording now uses the same contract.

### Medium: malformed numeric relationship data could become an extreme

**Resolution:** invalid baseline scores resolve to neutral defaults, invalid caps resolve to configured defaults, and invalid incoming importance is treated as absent.

### Medium: short names received substring relevance false positives

**Resolution:** relevance matching uses normalized phrase boundaries, so names such as `May` do not match `maybe`.

## v0.2.6 hard-pass findings

### High: minimum-budget Behavioral Profile could be order-starved

**Previous risk:** the identity block protected the Behavioral Profile as a field, but a verbose first rule could consume that field's compact share before later Cruelty or Independence categories appeared.

**Resolution:** essential injection now reduces every Behavioral Profile rule to a short semantic head in priority order, so Disposition, Cruelty, and Independence remain visible under the tightest supported budget instead of depending on rule length.

### High: tight injection budgets could still starve Speech/Mannerisms and agency

**Previous behavior:** the identity core was concatenated then truncated from the tail. A long Personality/Behavioral Profile could therefore erase Speech/Mannerisms, while Goal and Key Relationships remained optional.

**Resolution:** established identity fields are compacted independently and fairly, and Role/Goal/Key Relationships are an essential agency core. Lower-relevance NPCs are dropped before the top NPC's identity/agency is sacrificed.

### High: omitted developmentScale bypassed gradual evolution

**Previous behavior:** an `evolve` result without `developmentScale` fell through a compatibility branch and was accepted immediately.

**Resolution:** missing/unknown scale defaults to gradual. Gradual evolution needs fresh evidence related to prior evidence for the same labeled candidate trait across separate scans.

### High: `refine` could disguise actual personality/morality change

**Previous behavior:** a full-summary refinement containing old tokens could append contradictory traits, including generic cruelty, or use negated old traits (`no longer reserved`) while bypassing evolution gating.

**Resolution:** refinements now require semantic continuity, reject morality-polarity conflicts, and reject transition language. Behavioral Profile category replacement uses the same protection; generic cruelty cannot contradict an established kind personality on first pass or refinement.

### High: explicit/batch development trusted token overlap too much

**Previous behavior:** the code grounded development reasons by shared content words. A weak model could therefore turn one kind act into an invented explicit personality change, or combine a bare time skip with unrelated present-day behavior to fabricate skipped-period development.

**Resolution:** runtime merge calls provide the source narration. Explicit evolution now requires a nearby lasting-change/correction cue tied to the same content. Batch evolution requires the time-skip sentence (or its immediately following summary sentence) to contain the grounded developmental pattern.

### Medium: one-off gestures could become permanent mannerisms

**Resolution:** newly added mannerisms require recurring/frequency evidence grounded in context or cross-scan confirmation. Existing similar habits can still refine normally.

### Medium: focused relationship summaries lacked competing identity/agency context

**Resolution:** the relationship evaluator now receives compact Personality, prioritized Behavioral Profile, Goal, and non-player Key Relationships.

### Medium: sidecar pointer mix-up lacked chat-key validation

**Resolution:** sidecar reads validate the embedded chat key and new filenames use two independent 32-bit fingerprints. Existing pointer paths remain valid.

## v0.2.5 characterization review

### High: relationship context could outrank identity

**Previous behavior:** relationship behavior was essential injection while Personality/Speech/Mannerisms were optional enrichment, so tight budgets could leave high affection/tension instructions without the identity that should constrain them.

**Resolution:** stable identity is now essential and injected first. Relationship values are narrow player-specific modifiers, with explicit anti-obedience, anti-jealousy, anti-tsundere, and target-general kindness safeguards.

### High: temporary or player-specific behavior could become durable identity

**Previous risk:** repeated affectionate/stressed behavior could be learned back into global Personality/Speech/Mannerisms, amplifying an accidental archetype over later scans.

**Resolution:** scanner and targeted-refresh contracts now include an identity firewall. Gradual evolution is additionally code-gated by evidence carried across scans; ordinary NPC-delta output cannot bypass that gate.

### Medium: time skips needed controlled acceleration

**Resolution:** durable changes use gradual/explicit/batch development scales. Bare elapsed time is rejected as a batch-development reason, while explicit long-term summarized development can update directly.

### Medium: weaker models needed executable characterization without prompt bloat

**Resolution:** added a bounded six-item Behavioral Profile with compact labeled rules. It participates in persistence, editing, locking, import/backfill/refresh, viewer display, branch snapshots, and identity-first injection while remaining under existing prompt-budget tests.

## Scope

Reviewed the v0.2.4 extension source, runtime integration, persistence path, scan-context construction, Megumin dossier import, portrait-gallery rendering, settings listeners, CSS, tests, and shipped documentation.

## Resolved findings

### High: older sidecar snapshot could overwrite a newer in-memory edit

**Previous behavior:** `flushStateFile()` captured an early snapshot but, after upload, set `persistedVersions` to the latest live version. An edit made while the upload was pending could therefore be falsely considered durable, causing the follow-up flush to skip.

**Resolution:** one writer now owns each chat key, persists an immutable snapshot/version pair, and loops until the durable version catches the current version. Runtime coverage delays the first upload, mutates the NPC during the delay, and verifies a second upload contains the final state.

### High: chat deletion could race an in-flight write

**Previous behavior:** deletion cleared timers and removed the pointer without waiting for the active upload. The finishing upload could then restore a pointer after deletion.

**Resolution:** deletion settles active writes before deleting file/pointer/cache/version state. Runtime coverage deletes a chat while upload is intentionally blocked and verifies no pointer/file survives.

### Medium: rename bookkeeping was incomplete

**Previous behavior:** rename moved selected cache/pointer entries but did not consistently settle active writes or clear/transfer all write/version bookkeeping.

**Resolution:** rename loads and flushes the old key, settles destination activity, transfers state, clears old maps, and writes the transferred state under the new logical key.

### Medium: settings migration caused write amplification

**Previous behavior:** an old install could call `saveSettingsDebounced()` once for each historical schema block during a single `getSettings()` call.

**Resolution:** defaults, migrations, and canonicalization use a dirty flag and one final settings save.

### Medium: settings-only changes rewrote chat sidecars

**Previous behavior:** UI setting changes called `persist()`, which also marked the chat state dirty and queued a JSON sidecar upload.

**Resolution:** settings controls now use settings-only persistence. Sidecars are written only for dossier/branch/portrait state changes.

### Medium: long chats paid full-history cleanup costs repeatedly

**Previous behavior:** recent transcript building cleaned every message before slicing the last configured N meaningful messages.

**Resolution:** newest-first bounded collection stops as soon as N meaningful lines are found.

### Medium: dossier import scanned beyond the latest base

**Previous behavior:** matching Megumin dossier lookup scanned the whole chat, then discarded entries older than the latest New NPC block.

**Resolution:** lookup scans newest-first and stops at the latest matching base, retaining only relevant later updates.

### Low: repeated global DOM and roster lookups

**Resolution:** watchdog reconciliation queries are scoped to `#chat`; portrait gallery rendering builds one current-NPC map per render.

### Low: public/archive contract drift and retired code

**Resolution:** `NPC_ARCHIVE_REASONS` now includes `stale`; unused helper and obsolete CSS generations were removed; repetitive debug and settings-listener code was consolidated.

## Deferred, non-blocking observations

- `scanNow()` and `applyIncoming()` remain large orchestration functions. They are well covered by regression tests, but future feature work would benefit from separating model invocation, merge policy, lifecycle cleanup, and UI commit into smaller modules.
- UI rendering is still template-string based. A future major version could introduce small view helpers/components, but changing the rendering architecture during a maintenance release would add more risk than value.
- Browser/backend behavior is mocked in CI. A real SillyTavern deployment remains necessary to validate theme-specific CSS, provider latency, and image-generation backend quirks.

## Result

No unresolved critical or high-severity issue identified after the fixes and regression pass. The release remains data-compatible with v0.2.7 and older supported sidecars; settings schema remains v20.
